## 1. Project Description

The  Bakery  Management  System  is  a  comprehensive,  web-based  software  application
developed  to  digitize  and  manage  the  day-to-day  operations  of  a  bakery.  It  addresses
the  challenges  faced  in  handling  orders,  managing  inventory,  tracking  expenses,
maintaining  customer  records,  and  generating  business  reports.  The  software
provides  a  centralized  system  where  bakery  administrators  and  staff  can  seamlessly
handle  tasks  through  a  secure  and  interactive  user  interface.  By  integrating  features
such  as  sales  tracking,  expense  logging,  and  statistical  analysis,  the  system  ensures
increased  operational  efficiency,  transparency,  and  data-driven  decision-  making.In
many  local  and  small-scale  bakeries,  processes  such  as  tracking  inventory,  placing
customer  orders,  and  recording  daily  expenses  are  managed  manually.  This  manual
approach  often  leads  to  errors,  loss  of  information,  mismanagement  of  resources,
and  lack  of  accountability.  Moreover,  the  absence  of  real-time  analytics  limits  the
owner's  ability  to  make  strategic  decisions.  With  the  advent  of  digital  technology,
there's  a  growing  need  for  a  system  that  provides  automated  solutions  for  bakery
operations.  Our  project  is  inspired  by  the  vision  of  equipping  local  bakeries  with  a
user-friendly,  efficient,  and  low-cost  management  system  that  minimizes  operational
hassles and maximizes productivity.

## 7. Running the Application

*Steps to run the app locally, or access the live deployed version.*

## 8. Deployment Status & Tests

| Component | Is Deployed? | Is Dockerized? | Unit Tests Added? (Optional) | Is AI feature implemented? (Optional) |
|-----------|--------------|----------------|-------------------|--------------------------|
| Backend   |    Yes       |         Yes    |  No              | No                     |
| Frontend  |    Yes       |         Yes    |  Yes               | No                      |

*Note: Replace the placeholders with actual data. The optional features are nice to have but not mandatory but will be counted as bonus points if implemented properly.*

## 9. Contribution Table

| Metric                      | Total | Backend | Frontend | Member 1 | Member 2 | Member 3 | Member 4 |
|-----------------------------|-------|---------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|
| Issues Solved                |       |         |          |          |          |          |          |
| WakaTime Contribution (Hours)|       |         |          |          |          |          |          |
| Percent Contribution (%)     |       |         |          |          |          |          |          |

*Note: Replace the placeholders with actual data. In case of keeping the backend and frontend in a single repository, you can divide the backend and frontend contributions based on number of commits. In case of wakaTime just divide the total hours equally to frontend and backend for a team member.*
